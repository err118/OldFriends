Monica: It's because I'm scrappy.
Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Monica: I won't know what I would do without you.
(They hug)
Monica: Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.
(They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is "dancing" for Chandler, but she's really terrible at it)
Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
(Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again)
[A different spray-on tan center]
(Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.) 
Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Glenda: (quietly) Okay...
(Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles at both sides of the wall)
Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
(He turns around frantically from side to side.)
Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it?
(He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in this face and front again.)
Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH!
(He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.)
[Joey and Rachel's]
(Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed against each other) 
Rachel: What is the matter with us?
Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me.
Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
Joey: I don't know.
(Chandler enters the apartment)
Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..

Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
(Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get to them)
Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Rachel: Right, totally.
Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
Joey: That's a... pla-an.
(They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)
Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.
Rachel: I know.

Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted. 
Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...
(She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)
Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
(Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)
Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right.
(They look at each other for a while)
Joey: So...
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: I love ya.
Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Joey: Yeah, me too.
(Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.)
Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
(Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on his sore spot)
ENDING CREDITS 
[Ross's apartment.]
(Ross is reading a National Geographic on his sofa when Chandler knocks on the door.) 
Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
(Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.)
Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Chandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Ross: Really? Did you count Mississipily?
(Ross walks to the door and opens it.)
Ross: Dude, you're not tanned.
Chandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this.
(Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.)
Chandler: I see you later!
(Ross closes the door)
